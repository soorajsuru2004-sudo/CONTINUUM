"""Enforcing HTTP gateway: claim-before-fire for outbound requests (seam 4).

The last blind spot in the durability story is the one no harness hook can
see: an agent's code making an outbound HTTP call (from Python, Rust, Bash
curl, anything). This module closes it by interposing a local proxy that the
application points at instead of the real upstream:

    app -> localhost:8765  --[claim required]--> api.example.com

Decision semantics mirror `gate` exactly (issue #217): a request matching a
registered route proceeds only when a live STARTED ledger claim exists for
its derived key; duplicates are refused because the effect already happened;
uncertain outcomes demand reconciliation first. After forwarding, the gateway
settles the claim itself - COMPLETED on 2xx/3xx, FAILED-certain on 4xx (the
upstream definitively rejected it), FAILED-uncertain on 5xx/timeouts (the
effect may or may not have landed) - and records TOOL_COMPLETED evidence
with the response status, all in the run's hash-chained log.

Configuration lives in `.continuum/gateway.json`::

    {
      "upstreams": [
        {"host": "api.example.com", "methods": ["POST"],
         "prefix": "/v1/invoices", "action_type": "send_invoice",
         "key_template": "invoice:{id}"}
      ]
    }

Key templates substitute top-level JSON body fields, identical to `gate`.
Unknown hosts are refused (fail-closed): a proxy silently forwarding
anywhere would be an open relay wearing CONTINUUM's name. The route prefix is
enforced the same way -- a live claim for ``/v1/invoices`` does not authorise
``/v1/refunds`` on the same host, because the prefix is the only per-path
scope a route has (issue #1051).
