"""Merge through the shared precondition gate (issue #408).

Merge combines history from a source run into a target run at a common
anchor. Like fork and restore it routes through the shared gate in
``gate.py`` so refusal shape and lineage stamping are identical. For merge
the gate checks the span ``(anchor, head]`` on the target run; depended
results retain the fork semantics (full derived set) because merge does not
reactivate history the way restore does. The only per-edit difference for
depended results is restore, documented in ``gate.py``.
