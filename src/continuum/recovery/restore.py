"""Restore through the shared precondition gate (issue #408).

Restore reactivates history at an anchor checkpoint, discarding the span
``(anchor, head]`` and replaying from the anchor. It routes through the
same precondition gate as fork, reusing the pure derivation and the
identical refusal and lineage helpers from ``gate.py``.

Per-edit-type semantics for restore are documented in ``gate.py``: a
``depended_results`` entry that is only referenced inside the discarded span
is not stranded for restore because the pair will be discarded together and
recomputed. Only results still required by the surviving prefix block the
restore, which is why the same derivation can yield an empty depended set
for restore where fork would still block.
