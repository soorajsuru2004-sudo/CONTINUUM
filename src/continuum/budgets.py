"""Run-level retry budgets (issue #240).

Agent loops invent retries: a failing upstream gets hammered because the
model re-plans after every failure, and each attempt opens a fresh ledger
slot. RetryGuard (arXiv:2511.23278) shows local retry policies amplify cost;
the fix here is a *run-level budget* evaluated at claim time.

Registries live in `.continuum/budgets.json` (JSON, matching the other
registries):

    {"default_max_attempts": 3,
     "action_types": {"send_invoice": {"max_attempts": 5}}}

`evaluate_budget` counts prior attempts for an action type from the folded
ledger and returns whether another claim may proceed. CONTINUUM never retries
anything itself - it counts and gates - so the enforcement surface stays a
single pure function plus thin wiring at claim sites.

Attempts are counted per idempotency key, not per action type (issue #368). The
limit is still configured per type, because that is the unit an operator thinks
in, but what it caps is repetition of one operation. Counting per type made
distinct work compete for the same allowance: three different recipients each
failing once, with no retry anywhere, exhausted a budget of three and blocked a
fourth that had never been attempted.

Authorization-bound budgets (issue #411) add an optional section keyed by
``(action_type, authorization_id)``, giving one logical authorization a durable
monotonic counter however many fresh idempotency keys get minted for it (epic
#390):

    {"authorization_bound": {"send_invoice":
         {"authz:stripe-cust-1": {"counter": 2, "max_attempts": 5}}}}

Configs written before the section existed load unchanged and read as unbound,
which is exactly today's behaviour. ``get_remaining``, ``increment`` and
``would_refuse`` read and maintain entries purely; ``save_budgets`` persists
them. Nothing gates on the section yet (that wiring lands with issue #413).

Where the registry asks for an integer it means one: JSON ``true`` is refused
rather than read as a silent cap of 1 (issue #429), and a rejection names the
offending value and its type (issue #326). ``save_budgets`` stages and renames
rather than truncating in place, so a process that dies mid-write costs at most
the last increment, never the registry (issue #427). Because that replaces an
inode instead of rewriting one, the staged file inherits the target's
permissions and ownership, a symlinked registry is written through rather than
replaced, and the rename is flushed: swapping the file must not change who can
read it, which file is written, or whether the write survives the crash it
guards against.
