# Framework Adapters

CONTINUUM plugs into agent frameworks without becoming one. The adapter layer
(`src/continuum/adapters/`) is a thin, optional facade over the core
primitives: storage, the append-only event log, the action ledger,
checkpointing, and the recovery engine. Each adapter records progress and side
effects through the ledger and routes external effects through the two-phase
intercept/complete protocol.

The adapters do not replace a framework's own persistence (LangGraph
checkpointers, LangChain memory, OpenAI session state). They add a second,
semantic layer: exactly-once side effects, durable checkpoints, and a recovery
verdict that is safe to act on.

## Installation

Adapters are optional installs so the core stays standard-library-only.

```bash
pip install "continuum-agent[openai]"     # OpenAI Agents SDK
pip install "continuum-agent[langgraph]"  # LangGraph
pip install "continuum-agent[langchain]"  # LangChain (LCEL + create_agent)
pip install "continuum-agent[otel]"       # OpenTelemetry bridge (span processor)
```

The `dev` extra installs all of them so mypy can type-check the adapter modules
and the integration tests can run in CI.

The thin hook adapters (CrewAI, AutoGen, Pydantic AI) have no extra of their
own. They bind to a framework you installed yourself, and CONTINUUM imports it
lazily, so nothing is pulled in on their behalf.

## The adapter base

`GenericAgentAdapter` is the shared facade. The framework adapters extend it:

- `capture_state` / `restore_state` - durable semantic checkpoints.
- `intercept_action` - idempotent external side effects via the action ledger.
- `resume` - recovery assessment (`RESUME`, `REQUEST_HUMAN`, `ABORT`, ...).
- `start_run` - creates the run and records `RUN_STARTED` as the log's first event.

`start_run` records `RUN_STARTED` itself. Without that event, projection,
replay, and restore fail with "the log never recorded RUN_STARTED", and a
non-empty log whose first event is not `RUN_STARTED` is refused rather than
silently misordered.

## Generic Python

The in-process facade for hand-rolled loops. It writes trusted
(`Origin.DETERMINISTIC`) state.

```python
from continuum.adapters import GenericAgentAdapter

adapter = GenericAgentAdapter(store)
adapter.start_run(goal="analyze documents", run_id="r1")
```

## OpenAI Agents SDK

Wraps `function_tool` and `RunHooks`. Importing the adapter requires
`openai-agents` to be installed. State is reported with
`Origin.EXTERNAL_AGENT` provenance (see Provenance below).

## LangGraph

Wraps a `StateGraph`. Add `checkpoint_node` as a graph node and wrap tools with
`wrap_tool`.

```python
from continuum.adapters import LangGraphAgentAdapter
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

adapter = LangGraphAgentAdapter(store)
adapter.start_run(goal="process orders", run_id="lg1")


@adapter.wrap_tool("notify.customer")
def notify(order_id: str, *, continuum_run_id: str = "") -> str:
    return send_email(order_id)


def checkpoint(state: dict) -> dict:
    return adapter.checkpoint_node(state)


builder = StateGraph(MyState)
builder.add_node("work", work)
builder.add_node("checkpoint", checkpoint)
builder.add_edge(START, "work")
builder.add_edge("work", "checkpoint")
builder.add_edge("checkpoint", END)
graph = builder.compile()
graph.invoke({"continuum_run_id": "lg1", "order_id": "O-1"})
```

`checkpoint_node` reads `continuum_run_id` from state, projects the current
semantic state from the event log (a fresh run with no events falls back to the
state dict; see issue #46), and writes a checkpoint. `wrap_tool` makes the side
effect idempotent across graph invocations. `assess_graph_recovery(run_id)`
returns a `RecoveryDecision` before re-invoking the graph after a crash.

## LangChain

Drops `checkpoint_node` into an LCEL `RunnableLambda` pipeline, and supports the
`langchain.agents.create_agent` tool-calling loop.

### LCEL pipeline

```python
from continuum.adapters import LangChainAgentAdapter
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

adapter = LangChainAgentAdapter(store)
adapter.start_run(goal="process orders", run_id="lc1")


@adapter.wrap_tool("notify.customer")
def notify(order_id: str, *, continuum_run_id: str = "") -> str:
    return send_email(order_id)


def work(state: dict) -> dict:
    notify(order_id=state["order_id"], continuum_run_id=state["continuum_run_id"])
    return {**state, "done": True}


chain = RunnableLambda(work) | RunnableLambda(adapter.checkpoint_node)
chain.invoke({"continuum_run_id": "lc1", "order_id": "O-1"})
```

LangChain `RunnableLambda` replaces state rather than merging it (unlike a
LangGraph node), so each step must return the full state dict, including
`continuum_run_id`, for downstream nodes to find it.

### Real agent (create_agent)

Wire a wrapped LangChain `Tool` and a checkpoint callback into a real agent:

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain_core.tools import Tool
from langchain_core.callbacks import BaseCallbackHandler

adapter.start_run(goal="process orders", run_id="lc1")


@adapter.wrap_tool("notify.customer")
def _notify(order_id: str, *, continuum_run_id: str = "") -> str:
    return send_email(order_id)


def notify_tool(order_id: str) -> str:
    return _notify(order_id=order_id, continuum_run_id="lc1")


tool = Tool(name="notify", func=notify_tool, description="Notify a customer")


class Checkpointer(BaseCallbackHandler):
    def on_tool_end(self, output, **kwargs):
        adapter.checkpoint_node({"continuum_run_id": "lc1", "goal": "process orders"})


agent = create_agent(llm, [tool])
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [("user", "notify the customer")]},
    config={"callbacks": [Checkpointer()]},
)
```

When the agent calls the tool more than once in a run, `wrap_tool` collapses
the calls into a single external side effect, provided the argument-hash key is
stable across calls.

### Explicit idempotency key (real-LLM safe)

Argument-hash dedup assumes identical arguments mean the same operation. An LLM
does not honour that assumption: it can stuff a generated sentence into a
parameter, rename the parameter, or otherwise render the same logical operation
with different argument text between calls. When the argument shape drifts, the
hash differs and dedup silently fails, re-firing the side effect.

Pass an explicit, Stripe-style key to identify the operation by its resource
identity instead of its argument bytes:

```python
@adapter.wrap_tool("notify.customer", key="notify:O-9")
def _notify(order_id: str, *, continuum_run_id: str = "") -> str:
    return send_email(order_id)
```

Or derive it per call with `key_fn` when the identity lives in an argument:

```python
@adapter.wrap_tool(
    "notify.customer",
    key_fn=lambda *a, **k: f"notify:{str(k.get('order_id', '')).strip()}",
)
def _notify(order_id: str, *, continuum_run_id: str = "") -> str:
    return send_email(order_id)
```

Both forward to `ActionLedger.claim(key=...)`, so two calls that share the action
type and key collapse to one external side effect regardless of argument drift.
`key` and `key_fn` are mutually exclusive; `key_fn` is called with the tool's
`(*args, **kwargs)`.

`LangGraphAgentAdapter.wrap_tool` and `OpenAIAgentAdapter.wrap_function_tool`
expose the same `key` / `key_fn` parameters, so the pattern applies uniformly
across all three framework adapters.

## Thin hook adapters

Three further production frameworks are covered with no class adapter at all.
Each one already exposes a tool-call interception surface, so
`src/continuum/adapters/thin.py` registers on that surface instead of wrapping
the framework:

| Framework | Interception surface | Entry point |
|:--|:--|:--|
| CrewAI | global before/after tool-call hooks (`crewai.hooks`) | `install_crewai_hooks(storage, run_id)` |
| AutoGen core | `FunctionTool.run_json` wrapped in place | `wrap_autogen_tool(tool, storage, run_id)` |
| Pydantic AI | async Hooks capability | `Agent(capabilities=[wrap_pydantic_ai_hooks(storage, run_id)])` |

All three route through one shared `ContinuumToolGuard`: claim in the action
ledger before the tool executes, settle after it returns or raises. They write
ledger events only and never semantic state, so nothing here is checkpointed or
restored; pair them with the MCP tools or one of the adapters above when the run
also needs recoverable state.

Framework imports stay lazy, so importing `thin.py` costs nothing when none of
the three is installed. `install_crewai_hooks` raises `ImportError` with an
install hint when `crewai` is absent, since it has a global registry to bind to;
the AutoGen and Pydantic AI entry points take an object you already built, so
they need no import and perform no availability check. `crewai_available()`,
`autogen_available()` and `pydantic_ai_available()` answer the question with
`importlib.util.find_spec`, so a probe does not construct anything.

One discrepancy worth knowing before you rely on the human gate: `thin.py`'s
module docstring says provenance is `EXTERNAL_AGENT`, but `ActionLedger` passes
no source, so `append_event`'s `Origin.DETERMINISTIC` default is what actually
lands. Reading the log back after one claim and completion shows it:

```text
1  RUN_STARTED      source=deterministic
2  ACTION_RECORDED  source=deterministic
3  ACTION_RECORDED  source=deterministic
```

So a thin-adapter run is not held for review the way an OpenAI-adapter or
MCP-reported run is (see Provenance below). Whether the ledger should stamp
`EXTERNAL_AGENT` is a code question, not a documentation one.

### CrewAI

`install_crewai_hooks` registers one before hook and one after hook and returns
an uninstaller:

```python
from continuum.adapters.thin import install_crewai_hooks

uninstall = install_crewai_hooks(store, "crew1", action_types={"send_invoice"})
try:
    crew.kickoff()
finally:
    uninstall()
```

The CrewAI registry is process-global, so the returned callable is how you scope
tracking to one crew run (tests and long-lived processes need it; a one-shot
script can drop it). `action_types` filters by tool name and lets untracked
tools pass through untouched: pass `None` to track every tool call. The before
hook never blocks a call, and the after hook leaves the tool's result
unmodified, so installing the hooks cannot change what the crew produces. A
tool that reports an error settles the claim as failed instead of completed.

### AutoGen core

`wrap_autogen_tool` replaces the tool's execution entry point in place and hands
back the same instance, so agent construction code does not change:

```python
from continuum.adapters.thin import wrap_autogen_tool

tool = FunctionTool(send_invoice, description="Send an invoice")
wrap_autogen_tool(tool, store, "ag1")  # same object, now intercepted
```

Wrapping `run_json` covers every execution of that tool, including calls the
model makes through an agent you did not build. An exception from the tool is
recorded as a certain failure and then re-raised, so the framework's own error
handling still sees it.

### Pydantic AI

`wrap_pydantic_ai_hooks` returns a Hooks-capability-shaped object with async
`before_tool_call` / `after_tool_call`:

```python
from continuum.adapters.thin import wrap_pydantic_ai_hooks

agent = Agent(model, capabilities=[wrap_pydantic_ai_hooks(store, "pa1")])
```

Register it through `capabilities=` or the hooks constructor argument of your
installed version. `before_tool_call` returns the arguments unchanged and
`after_tool_call` returns the result unchanged, so the capability observes and
settles without altering the call.

### Stable keys across the thin surfaces

All three entry points accept `key_fn`, and the argument-drift problem is the
same one the framework adapters have: the default derivation keys on the action
type plus an argument hash, run-scoped, so a model that renders the same
operation with different argument text produces a different key and the dedup
silently stops working. Pass resource identity instead:

```python
install_crewai_hooks(store, "crew1", key_fn=lambda tool, args: f"invoice:{args['id']}")
```

The signature differs from `wrap_tool`'s on purpose: here it is
`key_fn(tool_name, args_dict) -> str`, because a hook surface hands CONTINUUM a
tool name and one argument mapping rather than the wrapped function's
`(*args, **kwargs)`. Arguments are normalised before they reach `key_fn`: a dict
passes through, an object with `model_dump()` (a pydantic model, as Pydantic AI
supplies) is dumped, a bare string becomes `{"input": ...}`, and anything else
becomes `{"value": ...}`.

`ContinuumToolGuard` is public for the case none of the three shapes fits. It
takes the same `key_fn` plus an `external_id_fn(result)` for recording the
upstream's own identifier on completion, and exposes `claim` / `complete` /
`fail` directly:

```python
from continuum.adapters.thin import ContinuumToolGuard

guard = ContinuumToolGuard(store, "run1", external_id_fn=lambda r: r.get("id"))
token = guard.claim("send_invoice", {"id": "I-9"})
guard.complete(token, {"id": "in_123"})
```

Tests: `tests/test_adapters_thin.py`. Unlike the framework adapters' integration
tests, these need no SDK: each seam is exercised against a duck-typed stand-in
(a fake `crewai.hooks` module, a fake AutoGen tool, a fake Pydantic AI context),
because what CONTINUUM depends on is the shape of the seam rather than the
package. They run in full on a bare checkout instead of skipping.

## Transport seams

Two seams reach stacks no adapter can, because they intercept at the transport
rather than inside a framework. They are seams 4 and 5 of the five listed in the
README.

### Enforcing HTTP gateway (seam 4)

`continuum gateway --port 8765` runs a local proxy that the application points
at instead of the real upstream, so any language making any outbound HTTP call
is covered, including `curl` in a shell script:

```text
app -> localhost:8765  --[claim required]-->  api.example.com
```

Routes are data, not code, and live in `.continuum/gateway.json` (`--config`
overrides the path, `--run-id` pins a run instead of using the active one):

```json
{
  "upstreams": [
    {"host": "api.example.com", "methods": ["POST"],
     "prefix": "/v1/invoices", "action_type": "send_invoice",
     "key_template": "invoice:{id}"}
  ]
}
```

`key_template` substitutes top-level JSON body fields exactly as `gate` does, so
the gateway and the PreToolUse gate derive the same key for the same effect.
The decision semantics match `gate` too: a matching request is forwarded only
while a live STARTED claim exists for its derived key, a duplicate is refused
because the effect already happened, and an uncertain outcome demands
reconciliation first. An unclaimed request gets `403` with a reason that names
`continuum_intercept_action`, so the caller is told how to become compliant
rather than just being blocked. Unknown hosts are refused rather than forwarded:
a proxy that forwards anywhere would be an open relay wearing CONTINUUM's name.

`prefix` is enforced, not just recorded: the request path must fall within it,
on a whole-segment boundary, so a claim for `/v1/invoices` covers
`/v1/invoices/49` but not `/v1/refunds` or `/v1/invoices-archived`. It is the
only per-path scope a route has; without the check one claim spends itself on
every path the host serves, and the recorded evidence says the invoice was sent
while the upstream saw something else. A route written without a `prefix` keeps
the whole host, which is what the default `/` has always meant. The path is
normalised before the comparison (query stripped, percent-decoded, `..`
collapsed), because the upstream rewrites `/v1/invoices/../refunds` before it
dispatches and the refusal has to be about the path that is actually served.
It is normalised exactly once: `unquote` is not idempotent, so a second pass
turns a doubly-encoded separator like `/v1%252finvoices/49` into a real one,
and the boundary would then judge `/v1/invoices/49` while the upstream decodes
once and serves `/v1%2finvoices/49`, one literal segment that is not under the
prefix at all.

The claim itself comes from whichever seam the app already uses:
`ActionLedger.claim(...)` in process, `continuum_intercept_action` over MCP, or
one of the adapters above. What the gateway adds is that it settles that claim
from the real response instead of trusting the caller: COMPLETED on 2xx and 3xx,
FAILED-certain on 4xx (the upstream definitively rejected it), FAILED-uncertain
on 5xx and on timeouts (the effect may or may not have landed). A completed call
also records `TOOL_COMPLETED` evidence carrying the response status, and stamps
the action's external id with `METHOD path -> status`, so reconciliation can see
what the upstream actually answered. An unreachable upstream answers `502` and
leaves the action uncertain, which is the honest outcome for an effect nobody can
account for. Tests: `tests/test_gateway.py`.

### OpenTelemetry bridge (seam 5)

When the stack is already traced, `make_span_processor` turns that telemetry into
evidence with no change to the traced application:

```python
import continuum.otel

provider.add_span_processor(continuum.otel.make_span_processor(storage))
```

A span counts as a tool call when any of `gen_ai.tool.name`, `tool.name`,
`openinference.tool.name`, `mcp.tool.name` or `function.name` is set, first match
wins. Recognition is deliberately heuristic because production pipelines use
several attribute conventions. The payload shape matches `continuum observe`'s
(`tool`, an optional `path` from the same key order the hook uses, and
`via: "otel"`), so a span-sourced observation and a hook-sourced one are
indistinguishable downstream. Non-tool spans are ignored, a failed span records
`TOOL_FAILED` instead of `TOOL_COMPLETED`, and a span that arrives with no active
run is dropped rather than raising, because tracing outlives any single run.

Two limits worth stating. This seam is evidence only: it observes ended spans and
never blocks, so an unclaimed effect is recorded rather than refused, which is the
gateway's job. And the `[otel]` extra pins `opentelemetry-api`, while
`make_span_processor` imports `SpanProcessor` from `opentelemetry.sdk.trace`; any
app that constructs its own `TracerProvider` already has the SDK, but a bare
`[otel]` install does not, and the call raises `RuntimeError` with an install hint
rather than failing at import time.

Tests: `tests/test_otel.py`, which drives the pure core
(`observation_from_span`, `record_span`) with duck-typed spans. Only
`test_processor_end_to_end_when_sdk_present` needs the real SDK, and it skips
without it; the missing-SDK hint is asserted too.

Beyond these two, `continuum serve` exposes the same operations as the MCP tools
over a language-agnostic JSON wire protocol (stdio, or `--transport http` with
`CONTINUUM_SERVE_TOKEN` auth) for a stack that wants to call CONTINUUM directly
rather than be intercepted.

## Exactly-once side effects and recovery

- External side effects are claimed in the action ledger before execution and
  completed after. A second call with the same run-scoped arguments returns the
  cached result without re-executing the underlying function.
- When the caller cannot guarantee stable argument text (an LLM-driven tool),
  pass an explicit `key` or `key_fn` to `wrap_tool` so dedup keys on resource
  identity rather than the argument hash.
- `checkpoint_node` persists a `STATE_CHECKPOINTED` event and a restorable
  semantic state.
- `assess_graph_recovery` / `assess_langchain_recovery` (or `resume`) validates
  the state and returns a `RecoveryDecision`.

### Provenance and the human gate

A run started through the LangGraph or LangChain adapter is recorded with
`Origin.DETERMINISTIC` provenance, because the adapter is the orchestrator
starting the run on CONTINUUM's behalf. A consistent such run resumes
(`RESUME`) without a human in the loop.

State reported over MCP, or through the OpenAI adapter, uses
`Origin.EXTERNAL_AGENT` provenance, which the validator marks `REQUIRES_REVIEW`.
That is intentional: an agent must not validate its own unverified work. The
consequence is that such runs resolve to `request_human` on `continuum resume`
until a human has eyeballed them.

## Integration tests

The adapter-specific end-to-end tests live in:

- `tests/test_integration_langgraph.py` - checkpoint durability, exactly-once
  side effect across duplicate runs, and a crash after the checkpoint that does
  not duplicate the side effect on resume.
- `tests/test_integration_langchain.py` - LCEL pipeline checkpoint and
  exactly-once side effect, and the same crash-after-checkpoint resume.
- `tests/test_integration_langchain_agent.py` - a real `create_agent`
  tool-calling loop (offline, driven by a scripted fake model) proving the
  side effect fires once even when the agent repeats the tool call, and stays
  once across separate agent invocations.
- `tests/test_integration_langchain.py::TestLangChainArchitecture::test_explicit_key_deduplicates_against_argument_drift`
  and `test_key_fn_derives_key_from_call_arguments` - prove an explicit
  `key` / `key_fn` collapses repeated calls even when the argument text drifts
  between invocations.

Each test imports its framework with `pytest.importorskip`, so it is collected
but skipped when the optional dependency is not installed.

The thin hook adapters and the two transport seams need no framework SDK to be
meaningful, so their tests run on a bare checkout:

- `tests/test_adapters_thin.py` - all three hook surfaces against duck-typed
  stand-ins, plus the shared guard's claim / complete / fail paths.
- `tests/test_gateway.py` - a live upstream on an ephemeral port through the
  real HTTP stack: unclaimed requests denied, duplicates refused, unknown hosts
  refused fail-closed, and claims settled from the response status.
- `tests/test_otel.py` - span recognition and evidence recording against
  duck-typed spans; one processor test is gated on the OTel SDK and skips
  without it.

### Real-LLM harness

`examples/langchain_real_llm.py` drives the LangChain adapter against a live
OpenAI-compatible model through OpenRouter (`ChatOpenAI` with
`base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"`). It runs a real `create_agent`
tool-calling loop over the same CONTINUUM run twice (a first pass plus a resume)
and asserts the wrapped external side effect fires exactly once. The model is
selected via `OPENROUTER_MODEL` (default `openai/gpt-4o-mini`); the key is read
from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and never written to disk. Run it with:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... OPENROUTER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini \
  python examples/langchain_real_llm.py
```

It exercises the exact gap the scripted tests cannot: a live LLM produces
drifting argument text, and the stable `key` is what keeps the side effect
idempotent. See STATUS.md (Real-LLM framework adapter test, 2026-08-15) for the
recorded output and what it establishes.

`examples/openai_real_llm.py` and `examples/langgraph_real_llm.py` run the same
dual-invocation contract (first pass plus resume, exactly-once side effect) for the
OpenAI Agents SDK and LangGraph adapters respectively, using the same OpenRouter
setup. The OpenAI harness must use `OpenAIChatCompletionsModel` over the chat
completions endpoint, because OpenRouter does not fully support the Agents SDK's
Responses API. `examples/multitool_real_llm.py` is the richer live demo: a single
model prompt orchestrates three tools (lookup, notify, open ticket) through the
LangGraph adapter, each side effect wrapped with a *fixed* idempotency key, proving
exactly-once survives the model's argument drift across a soft resume.

`examples/langchain_real_llm_crash.py` drives the hard-crash contract with a live
model: the `crash` subcommand lets the agent call the wrapped tool (which performs a
real outbox write) and then hard-exits the process (`os._exit(137)`) before the
ledger records completion; the `resume` subcommand runs a fresh process that calls
`RecoveryEngine.assess`, which must report `request_human` / `safe=False` with one
uncertain action and an outbox that still holds exactly one entry. This shows a live
model's side effect is left uncertain on a mid-side-effect kill and is never
duplicated on reconciliation. `examples/openai_real_llm_crash.py` and
`examples/langgraph_real_llm_crash.py` drive the identical contract for the OpenAI
Agents SDK and LangGraph adapters (the OpenAI one uses `OpenAIChatCompletionsModel`
over the chat completions endpoint, as its soft-resume sibling does). All three
adapters' hard-crash paths are now verified against a live model. Same env vars
apply:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... python examples/langchain_real_llm_crash.py crash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... python examples/langchain_real_llm_crash.py resume
```


## Live LLM validation results (real model via OpenRouter)

All three framework adapters were driven against a live `gpt-4o-mini` through
OpenRouter (key from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, never written to disk). Each was proven
two ways: a soft resume (exactly-once side effect across a second clean invocation)
and a hard crash (`os._exit(137)` mid-side-effect, then a fresh process asserts the
run is blocked as uncertain). A richer `examples/multitool_real_llm.py` demo has one
prompt orchestrate `lookup_order` + `notify_customer` + `create_ticket` through the
LangGraph adapter.

| Adapter    | Soft resume (exactly-once)             | Hard crash (resume blocked)       |
|------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| LangChain  | PASS, 1 side effect, `resume` safe     | PASS, `request_human`, 1 uncertain |
| OpenAI SDK | PASS, 1 side effect, `request_human`*  | PASS, `request_human`, 1 uncertain |
| LangGraph  | PASS, 1 side effect, `resume` safe     | PASS, `request_human`, 1 uncertain |

\* The OpenAI adapter yields `request_human` even on a clean soft resume because it
records `Origin.EXTERNAL_AGENT`: an agent must not self-certify its own unverified
work. That is expected and safe. LangChain and LangGraph use `Origin.DETERMINISTIC`
and resume cleanly.

Two OpenAI-adapter bugs that only surface with a real model were found and fixed:
the tool JSON schema was emitted with no `type` key (OpenRouter rejected it), and the
context parameter was dropped from the inspectable signature, which bypassed
interception and let the side effect fire twice. The live runs also confirmed the
idempotency lesson: a stable business key (for example `ticket:O-9`) is required,
because a key derived from the model's rendered arguments does not dedupe the model's
argument drift and produced a duplicate ticket. Full run logs are in STATUS.md.
