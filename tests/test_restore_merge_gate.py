"""Route restore and merge through the same precondition gate (#408).

One parametrised suite covers fork, restore and merge so the three edits
enforce and refuse symmetrically. Falsifiable: restore skipping an unsettled
claim refuses exactly like fork, and reconcile makes the same restore pass.
Per-edit-type semantics for depended_results (restore reactivates history) are
asserted separately and documented in gate.py.
